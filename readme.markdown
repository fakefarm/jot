# Jots
consider jots as personal tweets. Thoughts tasks, or whatever you want to quickly jot down in the moment.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo

## Usage
This is a ruby file with some bash executable magic (for us newbies)
so, to start the file, simply type

    $ ./jot

This will allow you to type things as they come.

## TODO
- list jots
- search jots
- sort by hash tag
- add a date flag
- on quit, send user back to directory they came from
- execute without need of ./
