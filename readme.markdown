# Jots
consider jots as personal tweets. Thoughts tasks, or whatever you want to quickly jot down in the moment.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo

## Usage
This is a ruby file with some bash executable magic (for us newbies)
so, to start the file, simply type

    $ ./jot

This will allow you to type things as they come.

## TODO
- list jots
- search jots
- sort by hash tag
- add a date flag
- on quit, send user back to directory they came from
- execute without need of ./
- build rake tasks for reports
- create markdown headers per month
- create a jot title flag as an argument 'jot -friday'
- index action lists file names to review for jotting?

## report types
- total jots
- sorted by tag
- single page view
